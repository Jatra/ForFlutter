Build the FLutter module as an aar (flutter build aar)
then import the created maven repo into the Android prject.

See https://docs.flutter.dev/add-to-app/android/project-setup?tab=android-archive   

Easier than getting the "Depend on the moduleâ€™s source code" method working - which might be less suitable for when making the FLutter module for cross platform anyway
